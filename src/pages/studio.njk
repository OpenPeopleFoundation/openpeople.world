      <article>
        <h3>Ethics before scale</h3>
        <p>We only automate what strengthens trust. Consent, transparency, and opt-out controls are non-negotiable.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Data minimization</h3>
        <p>Collect the least, understand the most. Dashboards and ledgers are built to reduce surveillance, not increase it.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Transparency &amp; consent</h3>
        <p>Operators, staff, and investors see how the system works. Audit trails, shared language, and clear escalation paths.</p>
