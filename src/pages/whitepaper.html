    <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Open People is an open, non-profit protocol for human-aligned digital identity. It provides a framework where technology
      can represent human intention without replacing it — ensuring identity remains owned, portable, and revocable by the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protocol combines three lenses: the philosophy of alignment and structural empathy; a technical stack that mirrors
      human cognition; and operational practices that test alignment in live environments. Together they form a living system
      that evolves with feedback, context, and consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alignment is not a one-time certification. It is a continuous loop: intention → action → reflection → memory.
      Open People encodes this loop so it can be observed, measured, and improved without handing control to opaque systems.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 id="sec-1">I. Philosophical Foundations</h2>
    <p>
      Technology should mirror conscience, not exploit attention. The protocol is grounded in three beliefs:
      <strong>structure before power</strong>, <strong>humanity before machine</strong>, and <strong>alignment before acceleration</strong>.
      These principles keep systems accountable to the people who rely on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Structural empathy is the core idea: intelligence that understands context, honours consent, and remains open to reflection.
      Instead of optimising for prediction, Open People optimises for meaning — producing verifiable proofs of care, stewardship,
      and mutual understanding.
    </p>
    <blockquote>Technology becomes ethical when it remembers why we built it.</blockquote>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 id="sec-2">II. Technical Framework</h2>
    <p>
      The Open People protocol is a four-layer stack modelled after human consciousness. Each layer performs a distinct
      cognitive and ethical function while remaining auditable.
    </p>
    <h3>Codex — The Conscience Layer</h3>
    <p>Encodes human intention as verifiable structure: alignment contracts, consent schemas, and transparency rules.</p>
    <h3>Cortex — The Execution Layer</h3>
    <p>Plans and executes actions that respect Codex constraints, generating attestations and feedback loops.</p>
    <h3>Assistant — The Reflection Layer</h3>
    <p>Observes behaviour, detects drift, and guides ethical adjustments with human-in-the-loop explanations.</p>
    <h3>Temporal — The Memory Layer</h3>
    <p>Anchors history with selective memory, enabling portability, audits, and proofs without surveillance.</p>
    <p>
      The layers are separable yet interoperable. Any organisation can adopt the stack incrementally while keeping data ownership
      and governance aligned with local norms.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 id="sec-3">III. Measurement &amp; Metrics</h2>
    <p>Alignment must be observable. We rely on verifiable signals rather than promises:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VR — Variance Reduction:</strong> how closely outcomes match declared ethics.</li>
      <li><strong>DE — Decision Efficiency:</strong> safety-checked speed of execution.</li>
      <li><strong>QAA — Quality-Adjusted Acceptance:</strong> trusted outcomes per cycle.</li>
      <li><strong>FL — Feedback Latency:</strong> time from misalignment to detection and correction.</li>
      <li><strong>CRI — Cultural Resolution Index:</strong> fit to local norms and human context.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These signals roll up into a Composite Alignment Score, giving operators early warnings when practice drifts from principle.
      Metrics are transparent, non-proprietary, and designed for communal verification.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 id="sec-4">IV. Governance &amp; Open Participation</h2>
    <p>
      Governance is ethics made operational. The Foundation stewards the protocol as a non-profit, but power remains distributed
      through open proposals, rotating ethical review, and community assemblies. Every major decision includes a public rationale,
      vote record, and feedback window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Funding is non-control seeking. Research, code, and documentation are open by default. Forkability and portability ensure
      the community can evolve the protocol if stewardship fails.
    </p>
    <blockquote>This protocol grows through participation, not persuasion.</blockquote>

    <hr class="divider">

    <h2 id="sec-5">V. Conclusion &amp; Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Open People shows that ethics can be expressed in code without being reduced to it. When identity remains owned by people,
      data becomes meaning instead of fuel for extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next steps focus on live pilots, public alignment ledgers, device continuity, and cultural councils that keep the protocol
      grounded in human experience. The work is open invitation: join, critique, and build with us.
    </p>
    <blockquote>The future of intelligence is not control; it is coordination.</blockquote>
