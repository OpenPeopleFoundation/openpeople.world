    <h2>Why Open People</h2>
    <p>I learned hospitality by orchestrating dining rooms where every detail carries emotional weight. I learned real estate by listening to families making the biggest commitments of their lives. Both disciplines demand trust and systems thinking. Open People Studio is how I combine that instinct with AI — proving that technology can deepen relationships instead of eroding them.</p>
    <p>The early cortex() prototypes started as service rituals written in notebooks. Today we deploy them as Operator OS modules that help people make better decisions without losing agency. The mission has not changed: expand the scope and scale of consciousness, make life multidimensional.</p>

    <h2>Current focus</h2>
    <p>Open People Studio partners with operators who need AI to create clarity, not chaos. Our flagship pilot is Snow White Laundry (SWL) in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador — a hospitality venture running cortex() across build, finance, and operations before the first plate is served.</p>
    <p>When I am not in the studio, I am documenting the Operator OS, testing new alignment rituals, and mentoring founders inside the Genesis Centre network.</p>
